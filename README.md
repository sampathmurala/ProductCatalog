## Concepts: 
  Dapper ORM, SQL Database, Xunit for Unit Testing, Repository Pattern, Dependency Injection.
## Project Scope:
  A simple Web API for a "Product Catalog" that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 
The data access layer will use Dapper for performance and direct control over SQL queries, showcasing an alternative to full-featured ORMs like Entity Framework. 
The project will include extensive unit tests for the business logic and repository layer, using Moq to mock the database connections.

## Technology Stack: 
  .NET 8, SQL Server (LocalDB or Docker), Dapper, Xunit, Moq.
